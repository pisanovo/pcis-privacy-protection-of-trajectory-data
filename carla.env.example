# This file explains what variables the carla docker compose module uses
#  Create your own version of this file and pass it along as "env-file" when
#  including the carla compose module (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/14-include/)

# SSH connection credentials to connect to the carla instance
REMOTE_HOST=ipvslogin.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de # Remote host ssh will connect to
REMOTE_USERNAME=bartelmk # Username to authenticate with
REMOTE_SSH_KEY_FILE=secrets/ipvs_login # Identity accepted by the remote
CARLA_LOCAL_HOST=ipvsgpu1.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de # Hostname to bind to on the remote.
# Why do I need this? If the remote runs carla, CARLA_LOCAL_HOST
#  is just REMOTE_HOST.
#  If the remote is a gateway server, that hides the actual host 
#  running carla, CARLA_LOCAL_HOST is that host's hostname. 
#  Example for the latter: Carla runs on a gpu server, that is 
#  hidden behind a login server. Only the login server can reach 
#  the gpu server running carla, but anyone from the public 
#  internet cannot.

# Carla instance's exposed ports the proxy should forward.
# 
#   A carla instance uses 3 ports, a base port
#   passed in when starting carla (defaults to 2000)
#   and two subsequent ports (default to 2001 and 2002)
CARLA_PORT_BASE=3000
CARLA_PORT_SECOND=3001 # This is very likely CARLA_PORT_BASE + 1
CARLA_PORT_THIRD=3002 # This is very likely CARLA_PORT_BASE + 2

# The port the visualization backend should be exposed on (Default is 8200)
CARLA_VISUALIZATION_BACKEND_PORT=8200 # Remember this, as you will have to enter it in the visualization frontend's UI

# The port the visualization frontend should be exposed on (Default is 8080)
CARLA_VISUALIZATION_FRONTEND_PORT=8080 # The port you can reach the visualization frontend on
# Path to the visulalization frontend codes root folder
# (so the one that contains its dockerfile)
CARLA_VISUALIZATION_FRONTEND_ROOT_DIRECTORY=../../../carla-frontend/
